# LUNA - Discord Bot 🐱‍💻 | API Handling

Check out [LUNA](https://luna-cat-bot.netlify.app/), my Discord bot with a wide range of commands. One of her notable commands retrieves a cat gif from https://thecatapi.com/ and serves it.

This is achieved using a JavaScript function that fetches a random cat GIF from the Cat API and sends it as an embedded message in a Discord channel.
@returns The `execute` function is being exported, which returns a Promise that resolves to a URL string of a random cat GIF from the Cat API.
